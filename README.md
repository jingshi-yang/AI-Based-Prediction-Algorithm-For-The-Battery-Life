## Background

With development of renewable energy, Li-ion batteries are widely used in applications because of their unique advantages. The RUL prediction algorithm of Li-ion Batteries acts a great roles in energy industry, for it could help solving management and maintenance of Li-ion batteries.
In order to improve the accuracy and performance of the RUL prediction algorithm, *a model based on LSTM-RNN* is proposed.
This project aims to provide a model to predict the RUL of Li-ion batteries with high accuracy, performance and efficiency.
